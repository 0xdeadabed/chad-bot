# chad-bot

Is a stupid bot who responses to your questions.

This project meant to be extended to [ircserv](https://github.com/hypn0x/ircserv), tho it would be more powerfull in a near future.

The idea:
	We had to develop a bot to our project ircserv, and here I was like, well, why not creating a bot library, which could be extended to more sophisticated project in the future!

## TODO (Probably, or not)
	- Create a better database.
	- Store the messages in a more sophisticated way (first point).
	- Create a better parsing analyzer.
	- Maybe apply fuzzy string search (Approximate string matching).
	- Would see to work with JavaScript.
