#chad-bot

Is a stupid bot who resposes to your questions.

This project meant to be extended to [ircserv](), tho it would be more powerfull in a near future.

The idea:
	We had to develop a bot to our project ircserv, and here I was like, well, why not creating a bot library, which could be extended to more sophisticated project in the future!

//TODO
	- Create a better database.
	- Store the messages in a more sophisticated way (first point).
	- Create a better parsing analyzer.
	- Maybe apply fuzzy string search (Approximate string matching).
	- Would see to work with JavaScript.
